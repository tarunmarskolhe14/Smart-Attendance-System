# Smart-Attendance-System
The GitHub repository you've shared, [Smart-Attendance-System](https://github.com/tarunmarskolhe14/Smart-Attendance-System/tree/main), appears to be a project aimed at automating attendance tracking using facial recognition technology. The repository contains several Python scripts and related files that facilitate this functionality.

**Key components of the project include:**

- **`Attendance.py`**: Likely manages the core attendance tracking operations.

- **`Model_Training_Script.py`**: Presumably handles the training of the facial recognition model.

- **`Student's-registration.py`**: Seems to be used for registering new students into the system.

- **`haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`**: An XML file containing pre-trained data for detecting frontal faces, commonly used with OpenCV.

- **`trained_model.yml`**: Likely stores the trained facial recognition model.

- **`utils.py`**: Probably includes utility functions to support various operations within the system.

The repository also features a `README.md` file, which typically provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage guidelines. However, in this case, the README does not contain any information.

Given that the repository lacks a detailed description and documentation, setting up and utilizing the system might require a thorough examination of the codebase. Familiarity with Python and experience in working with facial recognition libraries, such as OpenCV, would be beneficial.

If you have specific questions about the implementation or need assistance with particular components of the project, feel free to ask!
